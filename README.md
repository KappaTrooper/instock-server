# Instock Inventory Management System

Instock is a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to streamline inventory management processes for a Fortune 500 client. It offers a scalable and efficient solution for tracking warehouses, managing inventory items, and optimizing stock levels. The application consists of a modern React front-end communicating with a robust Express back-end, powered by MySQL as the database management system. The development process adhered to Agile methodologies, with project management facilitated by Jira and collaborative version control managed through Git and GitHub.

### Project Overview
The goal of the Instock project was to develop a time-sensitive inventory management system. The existing system for the client was not scalable and faced performance issues under heavy traffic loads. As a team, we built the InStock web application from scratch, following Agile principles. A Jira Scrum board was used to outline the required tasks, and effective communication and collaboration were crucial for successful project delivery.

The application comprises a user-friendly front-end implemented using React.js, a powerful and scalable back-end built with Node.js and Express.js, and a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
